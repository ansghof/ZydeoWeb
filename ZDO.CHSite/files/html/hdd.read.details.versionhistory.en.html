  <h2>HanDeDict @ Zydeo version history</h2>
  <p style="color: #8c2c1b;">
    <i><b>Note:</b> This page is about the version history of the website you are viewing. You can browse the change
    history of the dictionary itself on the <a href="/{lang}/edit/history" class="ajax">History</a> page.</i>
  </p>
  <h2>2.1 &bull; March 27, 2017</h2>
  <p>
    A powerful collaborative interface that allows visitors to review the dictionary's complete change history;
    revise, comment, approve or flag existing entries; and add new words to the dictionary.
  </p>
  <h2>2.0 &bull; November 16, 2016</h2>
  <p>
    A major revamp:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The website is now a single-page app. In practice this means that search results show up faster because only
        part of the page is updated after every search.
      </li>
      <li>
        New responsive design with improved experience on screens of all sizes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Automatic suggestions when searching for German words.
      </li>
      <li>
        Entries that are more frequent in Chinese are ranked higher when searching for German words, which in practice means more relevant
        search results. Word frequencies come from

        by Cai & Brysbaert of Ghent University.
      </li>
      <li>
        The original handwriting recognition algorithm is replaced with an improved one based on
        <a href="https://github.com/skishore/makemeahanzi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><i>makemeahanzi</i></a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        I normalized HanDeDict's original dictionary file with more discipline to eliminate small errors related to special characters,
        spaces, punctuation etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        The site has moved to a new Virtual Private Server in Frankfurt, for faster response times in Europe. This provider also
        promises fewer short outages than before.
      </li>
      <li>
        The open-source code base has moved to a new Github repostory at
        <a href="https://github.com/gugray/ZydeoWeb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/gugray/ZydeoWeb</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>1.3 &bull; February 13, 2016</h2>
  <p>
    Stroke order animations without Flash or Java, based on
    <a href="https://github.com/skishore/makemeahanzi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><i>makemeahanzi</i></a>
    by Shaunak Kishore.
  </p>
  <h2>1.2 &bull; January 24, 2016</h2>
  <p>
    New functionality and improvements:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Annotation mode for longer Chinese search texts that are not found as a whole word in the dictionary</li>
    <li>Faster page load because the data for handwriting recognition is now downloaded on-demand, when the function is first activated</li>
    <li>Several small improvements for a better user experience</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>1.1 &bull; December 6, 2015</h2>
  <p>
    A minor update with improved experience on small screens (smartphones).
  </p>
  <h2>1.0 &bull; November 6, 2015</h2>
  <p>
    HanDeDict @ Zydeo goes live, about three months after the disappearance of HanDeDict's original website from the Internet.
    The site offers a simple search function for Hanzi, Pinyin and German words, as well as on-screen handwriting recognition
    without Flash or Java.
