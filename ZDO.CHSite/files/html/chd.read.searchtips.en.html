  <h2>Searching CHDICT</h2>
  <p>
    Simply enter Hanzi, Pinyin or Hungarian words in the search field to search the dictionary. No codes or special characters are needed; the website will recognize any form of query.
  </p>
  <h2>Pinyin</h2>
  <p>
    Pinyin syllables can include tone marks, but don't need to: <i>zhongwen</i> and <i>zhong1wen2</i> both work.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can separate Pinyin syllables with spaces, but you don't need to: <i>zhong wen</i> and <i>zhongwen</i> both work.
    So do <i>xi an</i> and <i>xi'an</i> for syllables that start with a vowel.
  </p>
  <h2>Handwriting recognition</h2>
  <p>
    Click on the brush icon for handwriting recognition. This is particularly useful if you come across an unknown character and don't want to bother with the "old-fashioned" radical-plus-strokes lookup.
  </p>
  <h2>Annotation</h2>
  <p>
    If you enter a long query of Hanzi characters that do not appear in the dictionary as a whole, the website will try to find the individual words in it. The result is an annotated form of your search text.
  </p>
  <h2>Stroke order animations</h2>
  <p>
    By clicking on a Hanzi in a headword after a search you can view the character's stroke order animation. Animations are available for 9,374 characters, both simplified and traditional. All Hanzi up to HSK Level 6 are included.
  </p>
  <h2>Searching for Hungarian words</h2>
  <p>
    If you enter at least three letters into the search field, a drop-down list with suggestions appears.
    The list includes words with an extra accent on vowels, so you can find <i>örül</i> by only typing <i>orul</i>
    on a keyboard that does not have Hungarian keys.
  </p>
  <p>
    The search also returns compounds and composite verbs by their parts, so if you search for <i>hallgat</i>,
    the results will include <i>meghallgat, elhallgat</i> and others.
  </p>
  <h2>Tone colors; simplified and traditional</h2>
  <p>
    Click on the cogwheel icon to bring up search options. You can choose to view search results in simplified characters, traditional, or both; and you can decide if you wish to color Hanzi to indicate tone.
  </p>
