  <h2>Bulk change 002: Data cleansing</h2>
  <p>
    The original HanDeDict data file has several issues. Some of these are marginal, such as inconsistenly used curly or
    straight quotation marks. Some are annoying, such as <span class="inline-code">&lt;&gt;</span> and
    <span class="inline-code">()</span> used inconsistently as parantheses, or double spaces.
    Some might have been caused by a script error in the original HanDeDict site, or in the Wayback Machine, such as
    <span class="inline-code">&amp;gt</span> (without a semicolon) showing up in various entries.
    Some are serious but easy to fix: e.g., missing spaces, because these obscure true word boundaries and prevent
    searching from retrieving German words that are actually in the dictionary.
    Some problems are serious
    but not fixable: the file often contains <span class="inline-code">/</span> as text, but this cannot be distinguished from
    <span class="inline-code">/</span> as the sense separator. Finally, the majority of the entries contains
    <i>(u.E.)</i>, which in HanDeDict @ Zydeo belongs in the extended format, not in the displayed entry text.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before import, a second script was executed to fix as many of these issues as possible without human intervention.
    The script records a new version for every changed entry, with <i>zydeo-robot</i> as the changing user.
    That is a placeholder for scripted transformations, so that bulk changes like this do not show up under a real user’s
    account that also contributes to the dictionary as a human.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the technical reader, it is easiest to directly include the relevant code that was executed for every entry:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="cs">private Regex reLtGt = new Regex(@"&lt;([^&gt;\/]+)&gt;");
private Regex reAngled = new Regex(@"\[([^\]\/]+)\]");
private Regex reCommaSpace = new Regex(@",(\p{L})");
private Regex reParenSpace1 = new Regex(@"\( *([^\)]+)\)");
private Regex reParenSpace2 = new Regex(@" +\)");
private string cleanse(string line)
{
    // Curly quotes, non-breaking spaces
    line = line.Replace(' ', ' '); // NBSP
    line = line.Replace('\t', ' '); // TAB
    line = line.Replace('“', '"'); // Curly quote
    line = line.Replace('”', '"'); // Curly quote
    // Remove "(u.E.)" from entry itself. We put this info into the Status meta field.
    line = line.Replace("(u.E.)", "");
    // Fix incorrect entities
    line = line.Replace("&amp;gt", "&gt;");
    line = line.Replace("&amp;quot", "\"");
    // &lt;something&gt; -&gt; (something)
    line = reLtGt.Replace(line, "($1)");
    // Angle [brackets] inside body
    int spos = line.IndexOf('/');
    string head = line.Substring(0, spos);
    string body = line.Substring(spos);
    body = reAngled.Replace(body, "($1)");
    line = head + body;
    // No space after comma
    line = reCommaSpace.Replace(line, ", $1");
    // Multiple spaces
    while (true)
    {
        string b = line.Replace("  ", " ");
        if (b == line) break;
        line = b;
    }
    // Spaces inside ( parentheses )
    line = reParenSpace1.Replace(line, "($1)");
    line = reParenSpace2.Replace(line, ")");
    // Trailing / leading spaces in senses
    spos = line.IndexOf('/');
    head = line.Substring(0, spos);
    body = line.Substring(spos);
    body = body.Replace("/ ", "/");
    body = body.Replace(" /", "/");
    line = head + body;
    // Phew
    return line;
}

  <h3>Repro</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/gugray/ZydeoWeb/blob/master/ZD.Tool/Wrk20Cleanse.cs" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Wrk20Cleanse.cs</a>
    from ZD.Tool is the script that was used. To execute:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Put <span class="inline-code">x-10-handedict.txt</span> from the initial transformation script in a subfolder named
      <span class="inline-code">_work</span> under the solution root
    </li>
    <li>
      Compile and run ZD.Tool with the <span class="inline-code">--20-cleanse</span> argument
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Output: <a href="/files/x-20-handedict.zip">x-20-handedict.txt</a>
    is the file that was initially imported into HanDeDict @ Zydeo.
