    It appears you clicked a link to confirm an action related to your account, but the link is invalid.
  </p>
  <p>
    This can happen if the link has expired; if you have already opened it and confirmed the action; or if the link
    was not copy-pasted exactly from the email message.

    Use the menu at the top to navigate, or <a href="/{lang}/" class="ajax">click here</a>
    to go the start page and search the dictionary.
