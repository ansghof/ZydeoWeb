  <h2>Searching HanDeDict @ Zydeo</h2>
  <p>
    Simply enter Hanzi, Pinyin or German words in the search field to search the dictionary. No codes or special characters are needed;
    the website will recognize any form of query.
  </p>
  <h2>Pinyin</h2>
  <p>
    Pinyin syllables can include tone marks, but don't need to:
    <i>zhongwen</i> and <i>zhong1wen2</i> both work.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can separate Pinyin syllables with spaces, but you don't need to:
    <i>zhong wen</i> and <i>zhongwen</i> both work. So do <i>xi an</i> and <i>xi'an</i> for syllables that start with a vowel.
  </p>
  <h2>Handwriting recognition</h2>
  <p>
    Click on the brush icon for handwriting recognition. This is particularly useful if you come across an unknown character
    and don't want to bother with the "old-fashioned" radical-plus-strokes lookup.
  </p>
  <h2>Annotation</h2>
  <p>
    If you enter a long query of Hanzi characters that do not appear in the dictionary as a whole, the website will try to find
    the individual words in it. The result is an annotated form of your search text.
  </p>
  <h2>Stroke order animations</h2>
  <p>
    By clicking on a Hanzi in a headword after a search you can view the character's stroke order animation. Animations are available for
    9374 characters, both simplified and traditional. All Hanzi up to HSK Level 6 are included. 
  </p>
  <h2>Searching for German words</h2>
  <p>
    If you enter at least three letters into the search field, a drop-down list with suggestions appears. The list includes words
    with an extra <i>Umlaut</i>, so you can find <i>Wüste</i> by only typing <i>Wuste</i> on a keyboard that does not have
    German keys. The search will also retrieve <i>ß</i> in places where you enter <i>ss</i>.
  </p>
  <h2>Tone colors; simplified and traditional</h2>
  <p>
    Click on the cogwheel icon to bring up search options. You can choose to view search results in simplified characters,
    traditional, or both; and you can decide if you wish to color Hanzi to indicate tone.
